The idea behind this book is that you can tell the same story in different ways, and the same goes for when you are coding you can implement a code the gives the same result in different coding styles

the computational task in this book is trivial: given a text file, we want to produce the list of words in the file and their frequencies, and print them out in decreasing order of frequency. This computational task is known as term frequency. This book contains 33 different styles for writing the term frequency task.
